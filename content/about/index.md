Perplex is a technical theme for Hugo, the fastest site generator in the world. It produces a typographic layout, which adapts responsively to nearly all screen sizes. It’s designed for optimal legibility down to a view-port of {$360} Pixels width.

Perplex is designed for the IBM Plex font family and best suited for content with mixed sections of text and code. The layout is vertically aligned to a baseline grid to generate a comfortable rhythm. Horizontally it’s divided into evenly spaced columns — their number depends on the screen width. On larger screens the responsive design is combined with view-port sized typography—a.k.a. fluid typography—to deliver a coherent layout. The CSS stylesheet is compatible with recent browsers used by around 95% of all users in the world.

The content for pages is most suitable delivered by _Markdown_ files in a directory tree, which determines the website structure. The meta-data for navigational elements, images and other resources is formatted by a data markup language: _YAML_, _TOML_ or _JSON_. Global data is contained in the project configuration, page specific data in the front-matter section of their files.
