Some doubts have been raised about the accessibility of fluid typography. But websites with a responsive fluid design can behave especially user-friendly and accessible. This site is an example.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

Fluid fonts depend on the view-port width of the browser. When a user changes the zoom-factor of his browser, they are not affected at all. We need to change their value, when we change the layout responsively. And for various reasons, fluid typography is not suitable on mobile devices.

A responsive fluid design is beneficial on larger screens---tablet size and up. Breakpoints depending on the ‘em’-unit allow to fit fluid text precisely into the variants of a responsive layout. On large desktop screens we need to stop the fluid growth at a certain size again.

A responsive fluid layout changes to a larger or smaller version in our favor as soon as a breakpoint is reached --- wether we  view the site on a different screen or change our zoom setting. And not only the fonts but the size of all elements will change accordingly, if they consequently rely on ‘rem’ or ‘em’ units. We may have to change the zoom setting by a larger step sometimes, to make a layout change happen---but that’s all there is to it.  

Just give it a try with {#Ctrl} + {#+} and {#Ctrl} + {#-} or the zoom setting of your desktop browser. You will be surprised how well you can zoom in or out of this layout.
