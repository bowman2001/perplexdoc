**Perplex** has been designed to publish information about software. It provides templates for a documentation with up to three section levels, a blog, longer articles and simple pages.

 The layout is optimized for strongly structured text mixed with code. The content resides in plain directories filled with **Markdown** files and supplemental resources. The Markdown files start with a front-matter section for the meta-data, which is used to build the navigation and other page elements. This file structure is rendered by [**Hugo**]({{< relref "hugo" >}}) — the world’s most efficient static site engine — into a website styled like this one. _Perplex_ works out of the box, no other software requirements than a recent _Hugo_ installation are required.

The chapters about _Markdown_ and the layout options assume basic knowledge of _Markdown_ and _Hugo_. Doesn't sound familiar at all? The following pages about these topics get you started.
