The concept for a layout geared towards classical typographic principles grew over some years out of many already existing ideas. I can’t even mention every helpful author I read about typography and CSS techniques. Many conceptual parts date back to [Matthew Butterick’s][mb] beautiful online book [{=Practical Typo&shy;graphy}][pt]. It also taught me a lot about typography in general and some about distinctive American-English features.

Perplex is --- as the name says --- based on [IBM’s[[ibm] corporate open-source font family [Plex][plex]. These fonts are made for technical publishing and even offer a serif version.

Without [Chris Coyier’s][cc] always up-to-date website [CSS-Tricks][cc] I would have been lost in the CSS specs. He and all his contributors have been clarifying the constantly evolving capabilities of CSS like only a few others.

**CSS-Tricks** has been acquired by [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) recently. Hopefully, their staff will keep up the good work.

Last but not least: Only thanks to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and its active and helpful community I could realize this theme. I owe special thanks to [Steve Francia][sf] for bringing Hugo to life, to [Joe Mooring][jm] for his numerous precise suggestions and examples, and of course to the long-time project leader [Bjørn Erik Pedersen][bep] for his ongoing enhancements and improvements.
