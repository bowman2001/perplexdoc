Perplex provides a typographic layout, that adapts responsively to modern screens. It’s designed for optimal legibility down to a view-port of {$360px} width.
{.p-first} <!--more-->

Perplex has been build on the basis of the [IBM Plex][plex] font family and is best suited for technical content with mixed sections of text and code. The layout is vertically aligned to a **baseline grid**[^1] to introduce a comfortable rhythm. Horizontally it’s divided into evenly spaced columns — their number depends on the screen width. On larger screens (view-port &ge; 592px) the [responsive design][rd] is combined with [view-port sized typography][ptres]—a.k.a. fluid typography—to deliver a coherent layout.

The **Plex** font family includes fonts for oriental languages written from right to left and for asian sign languages (some projected). So far, Perplex can't adapt to their needs, because I'm not acquainted with their layout habits.

Perplex styles the HTML generated by Hugo from Markdown content with _YAML_ front-matter data through templates. This documentation also is a continuous test for the style sheet and the templates — and a demonstration of their quality.

The stylesheet is intended for recent browsers used by around 95\% of the users in the world (as accounted by [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com)). The deprecated _Internet Explorer_ and _Opera Mini_ are not supported.

## Based on Standardized Markdown

Hugo’s default renderer [Goldmark][gmark] processes [CommonMark][cmark] Markdown and some extensions adopted from [PHP Markdown Extra][phpmex] and [**G**itHub **f**lavored **M**arkdown][gfmspec] (GfM).

Markdown is simple and simply great. It allows authors to compose the structure of (web) pages with a few intuitive markup characters in plain text files. These structured files are rendered into reliable and clean (HTML) code.

There are professional solutions for a CMS-like workflow with web-GUIs. But they require a lot of additional configuration and I haven’t tried them with Perplex.

Because Markdown is so simple, the complexity of the generated HTML remains limited. Most of the time that’s a good thing, but occasionally the content begs for variations in the layout arrangement or additional elements. Perplex offers both.

## Additional Styling and Elements

[Attributes]({{< relref "attribute" >}})
: are HTML attributes in single curly braces placed after Markdown elements. They are introduced on the pages of the specific element, whose appearance they alter, or in the chapter [Attributes]({{< relref "attribute" >}}) if they are of general use.

[Replacements]({{< relref "replace" >}})
: are shorthands in single curly braces. They refer to the few less important inline HTML elements, which have no counterpart in Hugo’s Markdown.

[Shortcodes]({{< relref "shortcode" >}})
: are enclosed in two curly braces and angle brackets — like `{{</* shortcode */>}}`. They can take input parameters and allow to extend Markdown with arbitrary HTML structures. They are a kind of superpower, but tend to get complicated. Perplex includes some shortcodes, but only in those cases, where a _replacement_ or an _attribute_ is insufficient. If Hugo already provides a built-in shortcode, its established syntax is preserved as good as possible.

## Structured by YAML

The complete navigation and all other page layout elements besides the content are controlled by meta-data parameters. This documentation relies on [**Y**AML **A**in’t **M**arkup **L**anguage](https://yaml.org) to format the data, because it’s well-known and has the widest support.

{{< sidenote up=14 >}}
Hugo also processes meta-data formatted by TOML and JSON and allows to convert front-matter data between these formats.

Site parameters
: for every Hugo project are contained in the site-wide [configuration][conf].

Page parameters
: are set directly in the Markdown text files. Every file starts with a YAML front-matter block, which is enclosed by three dashes `---`.
{.dl-loose}

Despite its successful efforts to make data-formatting as simple as possible, _YAML_ still needs to adhere to strict rules. This may be frustrating for beginners. Perplex provides skeleton templates via Hugo’s [`new` command][new]. It generates files with a working front-matter block for every type of content. They are filled with some reasonable auto-generated data and placeholders. The front-matter blocks for this documentation contain usually around 15 entries, and you probably have to change or add only a few of them in the beginning.

## In Case of Problems

There are _two repositories_ for Perplex. One for the [theme][theme] itself and one for the [documentation][doc]. The documentation ships with a copy of the theme, but all work on the theme happens only in its repository.

### Bugs or missing features in the theme

Please have a look first at the already existing [issues][issue] for this theme. Please create a new one, if it’s not already there.

### Errors in the content of this documentation

[^1]: The concept for the baseline has been inspired by [Plumber][plumber]. Despite precise calculations is the vertical alignment sometimes a little of, noticeably on screens with a lower pixel density—usually desktop screens. All browser engines seem to face an inevitable trade-off between the quality of the font rendering and the precision of the line height.
