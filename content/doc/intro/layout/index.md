**Perplex** provides a typographic layout for your **Markdown** content, that adapts responsively to nearly every modern screen size. It’s designed for optimal legibility down to a view-port of 360 Pixels width.
{.p-lead} <!--more-->

_Perplex_ has been build on the basis of the [**IBM Plex**][plex] font family and is best suited for technical content with mixed sections of text and code. The layout is vertically aligned to a **baseline grid**[^1] to introduce a comfortable rhythm. Horizontally it’s divided into evenly spaced columns — their number depends on the screen width. On larger screens (view-port &ge; 592px) the [**responsive design**][rd] is combined with [**view-port sized typography**][ptres]—a.k.a. _fluid typography_—to deliver a coherent layout.

The **Plex** font family includes fonts for oriental languages written from right to left and for asian sign languages (some projected). So far, _Perplex_ can't adapt to their needs, because I'm not acquainted with their layout habits.

_Perplex_ styles the HTML generated by _Hugo_ from _Markdown_ content with _YAML_ front-matter data through templates. This documentation also is a continuous test for the style sheet and the templates — and a demonstration of their quality.

The stylesheet is intended for recent browsers used by around 95\% of the users in the world (as accounted by [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com)). The deprecated _Internet Explorer_ and _Opera Mini_ are not supported.

## Based on Standardized Markdown

_Hugo’s_ default renderer _Goldmark_ processes _CommonMark Markdown_ and some extensions adopted from _PHP Markdown Extra_ and _GitHub flavored Markdown (GFM)_.

_Markdown_ is simple and simply great. It allows authors to compose the structure of (web) pages with a few relatively intuitive markup characters in plain text files. These structured files are rendered into reliable and clean (HTML) code.

There are professional solutions for a CMS-like workflow with web-GUIs. But they require a lot of additional configuration and I haven’t tried them with _Perplex_.

Because _Markdown_ is so simple, the generated HTML remains limited. Most of the time that’s good, because it’s therefor also predictable and easy to style. But sometimes the content begs for variations in the layout arrangement. _Perplex_ offers many styling variations and allows to inject a few additional HTML elements.

## _Perplex_ Layout Features

[Attributes]({{< relref "attribute" >}})
: are HTML attributes in single curly braces placed after _Markdown_ elements. They mostly offer alternative styling. They get introduced on the pages of the specific element, they allow to alter, or in the chapter [Attributes]({{< relref "attribute" >}}) when they are of general use.

[Replacements]({{< relref "replace" >}})
: are shorthands in single curly braces. They refer to inline HTML elements, which are missing in _Hugo’s_ _Goldmark_ renderer.

[Shortcodes]({{< relref "shortcode" >}})
: are enclosed in two curly braces and angle brackets — like `{{</* shortcode */>}}`. They generate custom HTML in the rendered page and can take input parameters. They allow to add any HTML structure to _Markdown_, but tend to get complicated. _Perplex_ includes some shortcodes, but only for those cases, where a _replacement_ or an _attribute_ is insufficient. If _Hugo_ already provides a built-in shortcode, its established syntax is preserved as good as possible.

## Structured by _YAML_

The complete navigation and all other page layout elements besides the content are controlled by meta-data _parameters_. This documentation relies on [_**Y**AML **A**in’t **M**arkup **L**anguage_](https://yaml.org) to format the data, because it’s well-known and has the widest support.

{{< sidenote up=14 >}}
_Hugo_ also processes meta-data formatted by _TOML_ and _JSON_ and allows to convert front-matter data between these formats.

Site parameters
: for every _Hugo_ project are contained in the site-wide [configuration][conf].

Page parameters
: are set directly in the _Markdown_ text files. Every file starts with a _YAML_ front-matter block, which is enclosed by three dashes `---`.
{.dl-loose}

Despite its successfull efforts to make data-formatting as simple as possible, _YAML_ still needs to adhere to strict rules. This may be frustrating for beginners. _Perplex_ provides skeleton templates via _Hugo’s_ [`new` command][new]. It generates files with a working front-matter block for every type of content. They are filled with some reasonable auto-generated data and placeholders. The front-matter blocks for this documentation contain usually around 15 entries, and you probably have to change or add only a few of them in the beginning.

[^1]: The concept for the baseline has been inspired by [Plumber][plumber]. Despite precise calculations is the vertical alignment sometimes a little of, noticeably on screens with a lower pixel density—usually desktop screens. All browser engines seem to face an inevitable trade-off between the quality of the font rendering and the precision of the line height.
