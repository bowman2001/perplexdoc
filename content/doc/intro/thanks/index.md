The concept for a layout based on classical typographic principles grew over a few years out of many already existing ideas. I can’t even mention every helpful author I read about typography and web layout techniques. Many conceptual parts date back to _Matthew Buttericks_ beautiful online book [_Practical Typography_][pt], which also taught me a lot about typography in general and some about distinctive American-English features.

_Perplex_ is --- as the name says --- designed around [_IBM’s_][ibm] open corporate font family [_Plex_][plex]. Its used differently here than on IBM’s pages. That’s possible, because their fonts are thankfully versatile and even include a nice serif version.

Without _Chris Coyiers_ extensive and always up-to-date website [_CSS-Tricks_][cc] I would have been lost technically. He and his contributors have been keeping track of and explained the constantly evolving CSS capabilities like only a few others.

Without _Hugo_ and its small but very helpful community I wouldn’t have started and never came so far in implementing these ideas. I owe special thanks to the current and long time project leader [_Bjørn Erik Pedersen_][bep] for his constant improvements of the software and his help; to [_Joe Mooring_][jm] for his detailed and precise suggestions; and of course to [_Steve Francia_][sf], for bringing _Hugo_ to life and designing its core.
