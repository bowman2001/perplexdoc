Usually we don't need an replacement code for a line break in Markdown, because the syntax is [already there]({{< relref "linebreak" >}}).  
{.p-first} <!-- more -->

But there is one case, where this replacement code comes in very handy: When we want to break a very long heading at a specific place, because the automatic line wrap in the layout would mess up its grammatical flow and its rhythm.

## A very long heading about a complicated subject{/}needs easily more space than one line
