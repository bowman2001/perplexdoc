Perplex is a theme with advanced layout capabilities for technical publishing. It ships with templates for a blog, a documentation (three levels), a news stream and long articles.

Perplex works out of the box. Only a recent Hugo installation and the theme are required to build a website like this from Markdown files and their resources.
