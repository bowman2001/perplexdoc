Correction marks highlight changes while working on a draft. Lately, strike-through has also become a hip visual style.
{.p-lead} <!--more-->

To visually record important changes in our text, we can expressively cancel a part of the previous version by marking it ~~strike-through~~. The opposite action is to mark a part as {+inserted} later.
{#layex}

The extension *strike-through* has been introduced by [GitHub](https://github.com), because a hell of a lot collaborative work is going on there. On a finalized page it tends to look unprofessional, if it's not some kind of change-log.

## Syntax

Strike-through is applied by surrounding text with two swung dashes `~~` on every side. There is no extension for an *insertion*, but you can use a [replacement]({{< relref "replace" >}}) starting with `+`.

## Layout 

Please see the [second paragraph]({{< relref "#layex" >}}).
