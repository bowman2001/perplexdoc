When the first paragraph contains a short introduction or summary of the page, we can style it emphasized and provide it as meta-data for search optimization.
{.p-first #first} <!--more-->

A lead paragraph is optional, but to encourage its use, every page file generated by `hugo new` includes a placeholder as a reminder.  

## Syntax
The [attribute](/doc/attribute) `{.p-first}` styles a paragraph emphasized. The additional _more tag_ `<!--more-->` marks the paragraph as meta-description of the page. Search engines and other automatic web crawlers may use it, to categorize the page and produce a preview. If we don’t need the special styling from `{.p-first}`, we can add the more-tag nonetheless.

{{< mnote up=17 >}}
**Hugo** always tries to generate a content summary, which can act as meta-description. But Hugo can’t analyze the content, it just strips the first sentences (≈ 70 words) down to unformatted text. This may lead to badly truncated text and sometimes even to nearly incomprehensible results, when these first words have been strongly structured by markup.
{{< /mnote >}}

## Result
The [first paragraph](#first) on this page is styled as lead paragraph.
