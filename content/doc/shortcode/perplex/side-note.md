A note adds some information, that is not vital for the meaning of a text, but may be helpful for the understanding. It may explain context or shed light on a detail.
{.p-lead}

A note should accompany but not interrupt the text. If the screen is big enough, it is placed at one of the side margins in the vincinity of its reference. On small screens it is placed inside of the text and not at the end like a footnote with mere technical information.

Because a long note would fill the mobile screen and interrupt the reading flow, it is shortend to the first three lines and partially hidden. The interested reader can make it fully visible by a touch or click.

##### Note Heading
When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.
{.blind}

On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.

###### Small Note Heading
But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.
